# flutter_tdd_clean_architecture

A new Flutter project for learn how to implement TDD and Clean Architeture in Flutter Application

## Getting Started

This project is for educational purpose, i build this repository based on Resocoder tutorials about TDD and Clean Architecture in Flutter.

in the website and youtube video, this tutorial is a little bit outdated, so im trying to upgrade it to the newest version of Flutter and Dart Version using the null safety version. And also i changed the mockito and replace it with mocktail for the testing
